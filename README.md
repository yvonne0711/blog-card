## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Reiterated my knowledge on CSS Flexbox and played with custom CSS styles. I used `display: inline-flex` for an element, first time I've used it.

### Continued development

Want to develop my CSS styling by learning more properties and values for custom styling.
